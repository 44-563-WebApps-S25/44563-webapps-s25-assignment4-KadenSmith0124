    <h4>
        Act 3, Scene 1
        <p class = "stage_direction">Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour</p>
        <h5 class = "viola">VIOLA</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
            thy tabour?</p>
        <h5 class = "clown">Clown</h5>
        <p class = "speech">No, sir, I live by the church.</p>
        <h5 class = "viola">VIOLA</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Art thou a churchman?</p>
        <h5 class = "clown">Clown</h5>
        <p class = "speech">No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
            I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
            the church.</p>
        <h5 class = "viola">VIOLA</h5>
        <p class = "speech">So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
            beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
            tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.</p>
        <h5 class = "clown">Clown</h5>
        <p class = "speech">You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
            but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
            wrong side may be turned outward!</p>
        <h5 class = "viola">VIOLA</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
            words may quickly make them wanton.</p>
        <h5 class = "clown">Clown</h5>
        <p class = "speech">I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.</p>
        <h5 class = "viola">VIOLA</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Why, man?</p>
        <h5 class = "clown">Clown</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
            word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
            are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.</p>
